  - And if the user is not logged in, show the pop-up asking them to be logged in.
    - Also, if the user is not logged in, a *register* pop-up can be opened as well.

  - In case it was decided to keep them, it's better to put them in the footer.

- In the begginning, the `roles` are going to be just `authenticated` users and `admin` user (me, who can accept or reject articles).
- 'Artículos': 
  - This section will have ALL THE ARTICLES `PUBLISHED`.
  - It will also have their respective author (as an `USER` inside the models). 
  - Instagram posts will be passed to this section.
    - The writers will have a `user`, or just a link to their social networks (Instagram, generally).
